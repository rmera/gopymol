PyMOL plugins with gochem!

A framework to develop PyMOL plugins using Gochem library.
(https://www.github.com/rmera/gochem). A PyMOL plugin executes a 
Go/Gochem program using JSON to communicates with it via stdin/stdout.

In the current proof of concept, only a stream from python to Go is used
 containing atomic data for and only one state, and a few simple options.
A protocol for more complex communication involving multiple states for 
PyMOL selections, and transfer of data from the go program back to the
calling plugin will be implemented.

Notice that the go program here will not work with the master branch of Gochem. 
You need to use the appropiate (pymol) branch. I do not make any claim about 
these plugins working at a given time, The project is under heavy development.

There is no publication on Gochem yet. If you use one of the plugins here,
or any program based on Gochem before such a publication is available,
please cite the library in your publication as:

chemistry". https://www.github.com/rmera/gochem
