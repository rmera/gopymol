PyMOL plugins with gochem!

A framework to develop PyMOL plugins using gochem. A PyMOL plugin executes 
a go/gochem program using JSON to communicates with it via stdin/stdout.

It currently contains only a proof of concept, which is anyway functional.
When properly installed (the go executable must be in the path and be named gorama),
it will take a selection from PyMOL and produce a Ramachandran plot for it. The residues
in the selection must be contiguous, and only one frame is supported.

In this case only a stream from python to go is used containing only atomic data 
(no options) and only one state, so it is the simplest case. A protocol for more 
complex communication involving multiple states for PyMOL selections, multiple 
selections, options and transfer of data from the go program back to the calling
plugin will be implemented.

Notice that the go program here will not work with the master branch of gochem. 
You need to use the appropiate (pymol) branch. I do not make any claim about 
these plugins working at a given time, The project is under heavy development.
