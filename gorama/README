This is goRama, a plugin to create Ramachandran plots from PyMOL selections using goChem.

*Dependencies.

None.

*Installation

Simply put the contents of the PyMOL directory  (i.e. the files gorama.py and gochem.py) in the PyMOL plugins directory.
Then, put the content of the Go directory (i.e. the file gorama) in your PATH.

Notice that if you have another PyMOL plugin that uses goChem you will already have the file gochem.py in your PyMOL 
plugins directory. You do not need to copy it again, but there is not danger in overwriting it.

*Usage

Give the plugin the name of one or more PyMOL selections, separated by commas. 
A Ramachandran plot named with the name of the selections separated by underscores
"_" and ending in "_Rama.png" will appear in the working directory.

Example: goRama is called with the following selection names:  sele,loop1,beta3.
The file produced will be named: sele_loop1_beta2_Rama.png

If one selection is given, goRama will color the dihedral for each residue interpolating from
red to violet (Hue 0 to 240) as the sequence progresses from N to C terminal.

If more than one selection is given, goRama will assign a color to all dihedrals from one selection,
interpolating in a similar way as the previous case.
